## Wayland compositor
#### sway-install.sh (new script coming soon)

```
git clone https://github.com/drewgrif/bookworm-scripts

cd bookworm-scripts

./sway-install.sh

```

Recently, I have been thinking about getting a jump on adding a window manager for Wayland.  Fortunately, there is a good "compositor" for this purpose.
Added scripts:

* sway-install.sh
* custom-sway.sh - replaces the default configuration files with my own.
* nwg-look - installs an lxappearance program to use GTK themes and icons in Wayland.
* rofi-wayland - designed to behave like rofi(xorg) but in Wayland.

NOTE:  The recommended login manager will be gdm3 or sddm.
